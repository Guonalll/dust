Two of our [LIDA](http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/) Data Science Interns have just presented their latest work.

 - Robert Clay presented an update on the _Understanding and Quantifying Uncertainty in Agent-Based Models for Smart City Forecasts_ project that discusses the use of an Unscented Kalman Filter to try to incorporate real-time data into a crowding model. <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/p/2019-07-22-LIDA_Update-UKF.pptx">Download Slides  (pptx)</a>.

 - Benjamin Wilson presented his latest work on using a probabilistic programming library (Pyro) to create an agent-based model. <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/p/2019-07-22-LIDA_Update-Probabilistic_ABM.pptx">Download Slides (pptx)</a>.
