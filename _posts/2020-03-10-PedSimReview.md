Thomas Richard, one of our Data Science Interns at the [Leeds Institute for Data Science](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk), [University of Leeds](https://leeds.ac.uk), has just produced an excellent overview of a large number of agent-based platforms and libraries that can be used to create simulations of pedestrians. The main aim was to find a library that will allow us to use data assimilation to update the state of the model at runtime.
