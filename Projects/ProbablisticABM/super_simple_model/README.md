This project explores modern probablistic programming languages and libraries for

## Getting Started
This document will help you to get this project running on your own machine.

### Installation

This project is being developed using Anaconda Distribution with Python 3.7. All version requirments for sofware packages can be found in [Requirements_Pyro.txt](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics/dust/blob/ProbablisticABM/Projects/ProbablisticABM/super_simple_model/requirements_Pyro.txt)

### Checklist for Dependencies
These are the core packages that are needed for the project to fully work;<br>
1.[Pyro](https://pyro.ai/), a universal probabilistic programming language (PPL) written in Python and supported by PyTorch on the backend.<br>

2.[Imageio](https://imageio.github.io/) a Python library that provides an easy interface to read and write a wide range of image data, including animated images, video, volumetric data, and scientific formats. **For the ability to render output as a video media format install;**

```
imageio=2.5.0=py37_0
imageio-ffmpeg=0.3.0=py_0
```
