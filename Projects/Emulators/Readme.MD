This project aims to develop a statistical/machine learning model to emulate an Agent-Based Model, in order to predict in real-time

The emulator is a representative of the ABM, that is much faster than the original ABM, and produce similar results to the ABM

We will evaluate the emulator with in-sample data and out-of-sample data. In-sample data means that emulator is evaluated with the data
similar to its training data, whereas out-of-sample data means data that haven't been used to train the Emulators

We will try Gaussian Process and Random Forest to emulate an ABM of pedestrian simulation, using Helbing's Social Force model
