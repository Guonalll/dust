\section{Introduction\label{introduction}}

Aim: How good is a particle filter at doing DA in a pedestrian/crowd ABM?

Structure / argument:
\begin{itemize}
\item Context: importance modelling people in environments, including whole cities.
\item What data assimilation is (\citet{wang_data_2015} have a nice, clear outline).
\item Difference between particle filtering approaches (that do not dynamically change the model \textit{state}) and others (e.g. EnKF) that do. Also note that this is not parameter estimation, although it could be.
\end{itemize}
