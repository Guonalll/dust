\begin{itemize}
\item How people have tried to do state (and parameter?) estimation in ABMs before
\item How to evaluate PFs and (broadly) where they have been used
\item Difference between normal parameter estimation with a (e.g.) GA and dynamic state estimation
\item Data assimilation methods, focussing on Particle Filter
\item Data assimilation methods in ABM (will be brief!)
\end{itemize}
