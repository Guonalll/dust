\begin{itemize}
\item How people have tried to do state (and parameter?) estimation in ABMs before
\item Difference between normal parameter estimation with a (e.g.) GA and dynamic state estimation
\item Data assimilation methods, focussing on Particle Filter
\item Data assimilation methods in ABM (will be brief!)
