This is an Agent-Based Simulation model of the bus route. 

Created by: Minh Kieu, University of Leeds

Version control: 

- v1.0: 5th Nov 2011

  A single bus route
  
  Random passenger demand (uniformly distributed)
  
  No dataset used
  
  No state trasition capabilities (not DA-ready)
  
-  v1.3: 8th Nov 2018
    
    Demand comes from an OD table instead of completely random
    
    Bus stop also stores visited bus and headways
    
    Export bus positions data with noise
    
    Export bus positions ground truth data without noise
    
- v1.4 12th Nov 2018

    Random speed (Normal distributed)
    
    Noisy states data and groundtruth
    
    Compile the data and export to a pickle
    
    Proper model parameters
    
    Proper model outputs
